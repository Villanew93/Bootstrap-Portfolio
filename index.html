            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <img src="IMG_3442 2.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Isai Villanueva">

            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Isai Villanueva. If it is easier I also go by Jesse. I am 25 years old and
                currently have zero Web Development skills. However am eager to learn! I was born in Murrieta,
                California and raised in Riverside County for 20 years. I am of Latino descent and able to speak
                fluently both English and Spanish.
                My all time favorite hobbie is going to concerts. When it comes to music I am very open minded and would
                attend any concert. Recently, started getting into surfing, challenging but worth learning. Not sure,
                but there is peace being alone in the waves. Currently I am stuck between two dream jobs or careera. I
                would love to teach English and Spanish abroad, preferably in Japan. As well owning a business is
                another dream come true. Not sure what kind yet, I'm thinking something in Web Development.
                Currently I reside in Murrieta, California. Have moved frequently since a young age, mostly due to
                parents work line. One of my favorite places living in was my parents home town Acapulco, Mexico. Very
                different from living in California, the culture is very different but very pleasent.</p>

            <p>Since the begining of the Web Development program in UCSD Extension Bootcamp the question, "Why do you
                want to be a Web Developer" has never escaped my head. Since a child I've always struggled with
                computers in general, understanding how they function and utilizing them was always a challenge. I
                believe in order to progress in life you need to adapt to modern life, including technology. The
                challenge is what keeps me going, as well as the opportunites this career will offer once I graduate
                from this course. I see a better and brighter ahead learning this new material.</p>
